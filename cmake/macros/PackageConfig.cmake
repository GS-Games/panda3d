# Filename: PackageConfig.cmake
#
# This module defines functions which find and configure libraries
# and packages for Panda3D.
#
# Assumes an attempt to find the package has already been made with
# find_package(). (i.e. relies on packagename_FOUND variable)
#
# The packages are added as imported/interface libraries in the PKG::
# namespace.  If the package is not found (or disabled by the user),
# a dummy package will be created instead.  Therefore, it is safe
# to link against the PKG::PACKAGENAME target unconditionally.
#
# Function: package_option
# Usage:
#   package_option(package_name package_doc_string
#                  [DEFAULT ON | OFF]
#                  [IMPORTED_AS CMake::Imported::Target [...]]
#                  [FOUND_AS find_name]
#                  [LICENSE license])
# Examples:
#   package_option(LIBNAME "Enables LIBNAME support." DEFAULT OFF)
#
#       If no default is given, the default in normal
#       builds is to enable all found third-party packages.
#       In builds for redistribution, there is the additional requirement that
#       the package be suitably-licensed.
#
#       FOUND_AS indicates the name of the CMake find_package() module, which
#       may differ from Panda3D's internal name for that package.
#
#       IMPORTED_AS is used to indicate that the find_package() may have
#       provided one or more IMPORTED targets, and that if at least one is
#       found, the IMPORTED target(s) should be used instead of the
#       variables provided by find_package()
#
#
# Function: package_status
# Usage:
#   package_status(package_name "Package description" ["Config summary"])
# Examples:
#   package_status(OpenAL "OpenAL Audio Output")
#   package_status(ROCKET "Rocket" "without Python bindings")
#
#
# Function: show_packages
# Usage:
#   show_packages()
#
#   This prints the package usage report using the information provided in
#   calls to package_status above.
#

#
# package_option
#
# In order to make sure no third-party licenses are inadvertently violated,
# this imposes a few rules regarding license:
# 1) If there is no license, no special restrictions.
# 2) If there is a license, but the build is not flagged for redistribution,
#    no special restrictions.
# 3) If there is a license, and this is for redistribution, the package is
#    forcibly defaulted off and must be explicitly enabled, unless the license
#    matches a list of licenses suitable for redistribution.
